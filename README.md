# JebsLang
JebsLang is a Java-based programing language that is made by calling functions/methods from the JebsLang template! You can use an already made Logger for debugging and easily create windows and elements using WindowManager!

### COMMENT VERSION
Everyone who doesn't know what to do or has trouble understanding stuff, the template we provide also comes with a comment version. So I've prepared a template that can walk you through every step of learning JebsLang. To get this version, go to my separate JebsLang Github at https://github.com/JebsDeveloper/JebsLang
